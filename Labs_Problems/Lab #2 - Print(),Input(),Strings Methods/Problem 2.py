# The formula for converting from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Celsius is:

# C = (F - 32) * 5 / 9

# Write a program which asks the user for a temperature in degrees Fahrenheit and print the equivalent temperature in degrees Celsius. For this problem, both values should be floats.


# Perform your development in the following embedded Repl.it IDE, but copy your final code into the text area further below labeled "Answer".

degreesFah = float(input("Enter a temperature: "))
print((degreesFah-32)*5/9)
