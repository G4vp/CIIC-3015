# You are building a battle snake to compete for honor and glory! But before you can do that, you need to take care of some fundamental details...

# Write a function called SnakeFood() which takes a battle snake game board dictionary as its argument and returns the cooordinates of the nearest piece of food, where "nearest" is defined to be the fewest number of moves away, ignoring obstacles.
